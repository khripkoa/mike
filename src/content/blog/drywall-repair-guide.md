    Drywall damage is inevitable in any home - whether from accidental
    impacts, settling, or water damage. The good news? Most drywall repairs
    are easier than you think. As a Charlotte handyman, I've repaired
    hundreds of drywall holes and cracks, and I'm sharing my professional
    techniques with you.
</p>

<h2>Types of Drywall Damage</h2>
<p>
    Understanding what you're dealing with helps you choose the right repair
    method:
</p>

<h3>1. Small Holes (Less than 1 inch)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Nail or screw holes from pictures</li>
    <li>Doorknob dings</li>

</ul>

<h3>2. Medium Holes (1-6 inches)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Accidental punches or kicks</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tools & Materials You'll Need</h2>
<p>Having the right tools makes all the difference:</p>

<h3>Basic Toolkit</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Drywall saw or utility knife</li>
    <li>Putty knife (4-inch and 6-inch)</li>
    <li>Sanding block or pole sander</li>
    <li>Drill/screwdriver</li>
    <li>Tape measure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Joint compound (premixed for ease)</li>
    <li>Drywall patch or scrap pieces</li>
    <li>Drywall screws</li>
    <li>Mesh or paper drywall tape</li>
    <li>120 and 220-grit sandpaper</li>
    <li>Primer and paint</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step: Repairing Medium Holes</h2>
<p>This is the most common repair I do for Charlotte homeowners:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Cut Out Damaged Area</h3>
<p>
    Use a drywall saw to cut a clean square or rectangle around the damage. <strong
        >Pro tip:</strong
    > Square cuts are easier to patch than irregular shapes.
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Install Backing Board</h3>
<p>
    Cut a piece of wood (1x3 or 1x4) slightly longer than your hole. Insert
    it behind the drywall and secure with screws on both sides of the hole.
    This gives your patch something to attach to.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cut and Install Patch</h3>
<p>
    Cut a new piece of drywall to fit your hole exactly. Screw it to the
    backing board with drywall screws. Sink the screws slightly below the
    surface, but don't break the paper.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Apply Joint Compound</h3>
<p>
    This is where patience pays off. Apply compound in thin, multiple coats:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>First coat:</strong> Fill seams and cover screw heads</li>
    <li><strong>Second coat:</strong> Wider, smoothing the edges</li>
    <li><strong>Third coat:</strong> Feather edges 8-12 inches wide</li>
</ul>
<p>Let each coat dry completely (24 hours) before the next.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Sand and Paint</h3>
<p>
    Sand smooth with 220-grit paper. Prime the patch, then paint to match
    your wall. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use a small roller for better texture
    matching.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        ❌ <strong>Too-thick compound layers:</strong> Multiple thin coats beat
        one thick coat every time
    </li>
    <li>
        ❌ <strong>Not letting it dry:</strong> Rushing between coats causes cracks
    </li>
    <li>
        ❌ <strong>Over-sanding:</strong> You can sand through the paper - use
        a light touch
    </li>
    <li>
        ❌ <strong>Skipping primer:</strong> Primer seals the repair and ensures
        even paint coverage
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Charlotte-Specific Considerations</h2>
<p>Our Charlotte humidity can affect drywall work:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Summer humidity slows drying time - allow extra time between coats
    </li>
    <li>
        Winter heating can over-dry compound - keep it covered while working
    </li>
    <li>
        Older Charlotte homes may have plaster - requires different
        techniques
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Call a Professional</h2>
<p>Some situations are better left to pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Water damage (may indicate larger problems)</li>
    <li>Holes larger than 12 inches</li>
    <li>Ceiling repairs (difficult and messy)</li>
    <li>Multiple rooms needing repair</li>
    <li>Matching textured walls (skip-trowel, knockdown, etc.)</li>
</ul>
