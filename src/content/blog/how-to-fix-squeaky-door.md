    Squeaky doors are one of the most common complaints I hear from
    Charlotte homeowners. While they might seem like a minor annoyance, they
    can actually indicate underlying issues with your door's hardware or
    installation. The good news? Most squeaky doors can be fixed in under 15
    minutes with tools you probably already have.
</p>

<h2>Why Doors Squeak</h2>
<p>
    Before we jump into fixes, it helps to understand <strong
        >why doors squeak</strong
    > in the first place. The noise typically comes from:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Dry Hinges:</strong> The most common cause. Metal-on-metal friction
        creates that familiar squeak.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Loose Screws:</strong> Over time, hinge screws can loosen, causing
        the door to shift and bind.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Misalignment:</strong> Settlement or humidity changes can cause
        doors to become misaligned with their frames.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Worn Hinge Pins:</strong> Years of use can wear down the pin,
        creating gaps and movement.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Quick Fix: Lubrication</h2>
<p>
    For most squeaky doors, proper lubrication is all you need. Here's what
    I recommend:
</p>

<h3>Best Lubricants to Use</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Lithium Grease:</strong> My #1 choice. Long-lasting and won't
        attract dust.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>WD-40 Specialist Dry Lube:</strong> Great for hinges that collect
        dust.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Silicone Spray:</strong> Works well but may need reapplication
        more often.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>What NOT to Use</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Regular WD-40 (attracts dirt and is short-term)</li>
    <li>Cooking oil or petroleum jelly (gets sticky and messy)</li>
    <li>3-in-1 oil (can gum up over time)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Application Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Open the door and prop it with something stable</li>
    <li>Remove the hinge pin (or apply lubricant while in place)</li>
    <li>Apply a small amount of lubricant to the pin</li>
    <li>Work the door back and forth to distribute</li>
    <li>Wipe away excess to prevent drips</li>
</ol>

<h2>When DIY Isn't Enough</h2>
<p>
    Sometimes a squeaky door indicates bigger problems. <strong
        >Call a professional</strong
    > if you notice:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The door drags on the floor or is difficult to open</li>
    <li>Large gaps between the door and frame</li>
    <li>The door won't stay closed or pops open</li>
    <li>Visible damage to hinges or the door frame</li>
    <li>The squeak persists after lubrication</li>
</ul>

<h2>Charlotte's Climate and Your Doors</h2>
<p>
    Living in Charlotte, NC means dealing with <strong
        >humidity fluctuations</strong
    > throughout the year. This causes wood doors to expand in summer and contract
    in winter, leading to squeaks and sticking. If you notice seasonal patterns,
    it might be time to adjust the door or plane it down slightly.
</p>

<h2>Prevention Tips</h2>
<p>Keep your doors operating smoothly with these maintenance tips:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lubricate hinges once or twice a year</li>
    <li>Tighten all hinge screws annually</li>
    <li>Check door alignment seasonally</li>
    <li>Clean dirt and debris from hinges</li>
    <li>Address sticking doors promptly</li>
</ul>
