    Updating cabinet hardware is one of the easiest and most impactful DIY
    upgrades you can make. For less than $100 and an afternoon of work, you
    can completely transform your kitchen or bathroom. I've installed
    hardware on hundreds of Charlotte cabinets, and I'm sharing the
    professional techniques that ensure perfect results.
</p>

<h2>Why Proper Placement Matters</h2>
<p>
    The difference between DIY and professional-looking results often comes
    down to <strong>consistent measurements</strong>. Eyeballing it leads to
    uneven spacing that stands out.

<h2>Choosing Between Knobs and Pulls</h2>

<h3>Knobs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>✅ Best for: Small doors, traditional kitchens</li>
    <li>✅ Single screw = easier installation</li>
    <li>✅ Less expensive</li>
    <li>❌ Harder to grip for large drawers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pulls (Handles)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>✅ Best for: Drawers, modern kitchens</li>
    <li>✅ More comfortable to use</li>
    <li>✅ Contemporary look</li>
    <li>❌ Two screws = more precise measurement needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pro Recommendation</h3>
<p>
    The most popular combo: <strong
        >Knobs on doors, pulls on drawers.</strong
    > This gives you traditional elegance with modern functionality.
</p>

<h2>Standard Measurements</h2>
<p>Follow these industry-standard measurements for professional results:</p>

<h3>Upper Cabinets (Doors)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Knobs:</strong> 2.5" from bottom corner (both directions)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Pulls:</strong> Centered horizontally, 2.5-3" from bottom
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Lower Cabinets (Doors)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Knobs:</strong> 2.5" from top corner (both directions)</li>
    <li><strong>Pulls:</strong> Centered horizontally, 2.5-3" from top</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drawers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Small drawers (under 24"):</strong> Single pull, centered
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Large drawers (24"+):</strong> Single pull centered, OR two pulls
        3" from each edge
    </li>
    <li><strong>Vertical placement:</strong> Centered on drawer face</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools You'll Need</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Power drill with bits</li>
    <li>Tape measure</li>
    <li>Pencil</li>
    <li>Level</li>
    <li>Painter's tape (prevents drill-through damage)</li>
    <li>Hardware template (optional but highly recommended)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Installation Process</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Create a Template</h3>
<p>
    Make a simple jig from cardboard or buy a commercial template. This
    ensures every hole is in the exact same spot. <strong
        >This is the secret to professional results.</strong
    >
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mark First Cabinet</h3>
<p>
    Measure carefully on your first door/drawer. Use a level to ensure pulls
    are perfectly horizontal. Mark both screw holes with a pencil.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Put Tape on Back</h3>
<p>
    Place painter's tape where the drill will exit. This prevents
    splintering and chipping on the interior surface.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Drill Pilot Holes</h3>
<p>
    Use a drill bit slightly smaller than your screws. Drill straight
    through. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Wrap tape around your drill bit to mark
    the depth.
</p>

<h3>Step 5: Install Hardware</h3>
<p>
    Insert screws from the back, hand-tighten the hardware from the front,
    then give a final quarter turn with a screwdriver. Don't overtighten -
    you can crack the cabinet face.
</p>

<h3>Step 6: Repeat Consistently</h3>
<p>
    Use your template for every cabinet. Consistency is key - one misplaced
    pull ruins the whole look.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them</h2>

<h3>Mistake #1: Inconsistent Spacing</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> Always use a template or jig - never freehand your
    measurements.
</p>

<h3>Mistake #2: Wrong Drill Bit Size</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> Your pilot hole should be slightly smaller than
    the screw shaft, not the threads.
</p>

<h3>Mistake #3: Drilling Too Deep</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> Mark your bit with tape to prevent drilling into
    countertops or damaging the opposite side.
</p>

<h3>Mistake #4: Not Checking Screw Length</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> Measure your door/drawer thickness. Screws should
    be 1/4" shorter than the thickness to avoid poke-through.
</p>

<h2>Replacing Existing Hardware</h2>
<p>If you're updating old hardware:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Same size/spacing:</strong> You're golden - just swap them out
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Different spacing:</strong> Fill old holes with wood filler, sand,
        paint, then drill new holes
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Covering old holes:</strong> Choose larger backplates or repositioning
        them can hide old holes
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Charlotte Climate Considerations</h2>
<p>Our humidity affects cabinet hardware:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Choose quality finishes - cheap hardware tarnishes quickly in humid
        climates
    </li>
    <li>Stainless steel or brushed nickel hold up best</li>
    <li>Oil-rubbed bronze can develop patina unevenly with humidity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Budget Guide</h2>
<p>Typical Charlotte kitchen (15-20 cabinets):</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Budget:</strong> $50-75 (basic knobs/pulls)</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-range:</strong> $100-200 (quality finishes)</li>
    <li><strong>High-end:</strong> $300+ (designer hardware)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Installing cabinet hardware is a perfect weekend DIY project that
    dramatically improves your kitchen's look. Take your time with
    measurements, use a template, and you'll get professional results. Need
    help or want a flawless installation guaranteed? I'm just a call away!
